  <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    When working with images, it is often easiest to represent them by their gradients rather than
    by specific pixel values: it is often more important to analyze and affect how pixels relate to
    one another than it is to use the intensity. As such, this project relates to several smaller
    components related to working with images in the domain of gradients.
    <br><br>
    The first of these sub-projects relates to rebuilding an image from its gradient and a single
    reference value. Because the image gradient effectively gives the difference between the value
    at a given pixel and the values of its neighbors, the values for all of a given pixels neighbors
    can be computed from its value and the value of the gradient at that point; when the method of
    reconstruction is applied across the entire image (in this context through the use of a system
    of equations), it is possible to accurately recover the entirety of the base image.
    <br><br>
    The second sub-project involved the implementation of Poisson blending to smoothly combine
    elements from multiple images into a single, seamless, and (hopefully) natural-looking combined
    image. To do so, the gradients from the two images are combined in such a way that they flow
    into one another cleanly; this will affect the color and intensity of the blended images, but
    the shapeand gradient of the image will be maintained (and, as stated above, the image gradient
    is usually more important than color or intensity).
    <br><br>
    The third component modifies the implementation of Poisson blending to preserve the gradient
    with the larger magnitude, potentially resulting in more naturalistic combinations of images
    which preserve more of the texture of the two images (rather than cutting a whole in one and
    plugging in the other).
    <br><br>
    In addition to these components, some other, smaller applications of gradient-domain processing
    were implemented as extra credit (described in the Extra Credit section below).

  <!-- IMPLEMENTATION -->
  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <p>
    Given the modular nature of this project, the implementation details have been seperated into
    multiple components by section.

    <!-- Gradient Reconstruction -->
    <h4>Reconstruction from Gradients</h4>


    <!-- Poisson Blending -->
    <h4>Poisson Blending</h4>


    <!-- Mixed-Gradient Blending -->

  <!-- SOME EXAMPLES -->
  <h3>Sample Output</h3>
  <p>
    As before, output has been divided into three sections to demonstrate the results of each of the
    sub-components of the project individually.
