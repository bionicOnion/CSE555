  <!-- PROPOSAL OVERVIEW -->
  <h3>Proposal Overview</h3>
  <p>
    For my final project, I intend to implement a software package to generate images similar to the
    one shown above&mdash;images which contain the low-frequency detail of some source image encoded
    within a graph. To do so, I will construct a probability distribution for point locations (based
    on the intensity of the image, among other factors), sample some number of points from the
    distribution, connect the points to one another, and then produce a final image. This approach
    could be expanded to work with videos, replacing each frame with a 'web' image (with some work
    being done to smoothly transition from one frame to the next).
