  <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    In many contexts, it may be desirable to extend an image (to enlarge an image, to fill in an
    empty space, etc.). Although it would be possible to simply copy existing parts of the
    image&mdash;or elements from other images&mdash;the repetition of elements of an image may be
    obviously artificial or aesthetically unsatisfying. Instead, a system to compute extensions to
    existing patterns within the image may result in more pleasing images.
    <br><br>
    The basic gist of this project is to synthesize new images from 'textures' found in source
    images. Textures are images (or portions of images) which represent a single object of type of
    object&mdash;for example, a texture may be a brick wall, an image of waves in water or grass,
    foliage, etc. Within these textures may be both high- and low-frequency patterns (e.g. the
    rectangular shape of bricks in addition to the coarseness of the surface). Texture synthesis
    relies on identifying and extending these patterns to create an artificial image with the same
    appearance and properties as an actual photograph, blending seamlessly with the photographed
    texture in the original image.
    <br><br>
    In addition to extending images with texture synthesis, images can be recreated with a different
    texture: by matching elements of a target image with regions of a source texture image, a
    synthetic image can be created with the low-frequency details of one image&mdash;the basic
    appearance of a face, for instance&mdash;with the texture of another image.
    <br><br>
    This project implements both of these elements using a relatively efficient block-based
    algorithm which finds a small chunk of the texture image which matches with the immediate
    surroundings and fits it into an arbitrarily sized synthetic image.
    <br><br>
